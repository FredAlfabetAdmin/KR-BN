This project contains methodes to make inferences from Bayesian Networks. It contains the following functions:
network pruning, d-separation, independence, marginalization, maxing-out, factor multiplication, ordering, variable 
elimination, marginal distribution, maximum a-posteriori query (MAP) and most probable explanation (MPE).
Which can be found in the BNReasoner_pruning.py. This the second project of the course Knowledge Representation.

To be able to run BNReasoner_pruning.py, the packages that need to be installed:
- typing 
- pandas 
- copy 
- random

In addition, the following packages are used in the code (and may need to be installed if not already):
- time
- numpy 
- seaborn
- matplotlib.pyplot
- os
- pickle
- scipy.stats

To show that our implementation works, you need to set the corresponding Bool to True in the BNReasoner_pruning.py:
- Pruning = False
- check_d_separation = False
- Independence = False
- Marginalization = False
- MaxingOut =  False
- MultiplyFactor = False
- Ordering = False
- Variable_Elimination = False
- Marginal_distribution = False
- Map = False
- Mpe = False
